            <h2>Why Iran?</h2>
            <h3>7000 Years Of History & Civilization</h3>
            <p>
              Iran is home to one of the world’s oldest living civilizations,
              with historical and urban settlements dating back to 7000 BC. The
              southwestern and western part of the Iranian Plateau contributed
              to the traditional Ancient Near East with the Elamite
              Civilization, from the Early Bronze Age, and later with various
              other peoples’, such as the Kassites, Mannaeans and Gutians. Hegel
              once named the Persians as the first Historical People. The Medes
              unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC. The Achaemenid
              Empire (550–330 BC), founded by Cyrus the Great, was the first of
              the Persian empires to rule from the Balkans to North Africa and
              also Central Asia, spanning three continents, from their seat of
              power in Persis (Persepolis).
            </p>
            <p>
              It was the largest empire up to that time, and the first world
              empire, spanning 5.5 million square kilometers, larger than any
              previous empire in history. Iran has also endured invasions by the
              Greeks, Arabs, Turks and Mongols. Nevertheless, it has continually
              reasserted its national identity throughout the centuries and has
              developed as a distinct political and cultural entity. Iran was
              reunified as an independent state in 1501 by the Safavid Dynasty,
              which converted Iran to Shia Islam as the official religion of
              their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in
              the history of Iran and also Islam.
